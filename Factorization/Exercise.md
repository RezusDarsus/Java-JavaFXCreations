# Prime Factorization Program

This is a simple Java program that reads a natural number \( n > 1 \) from the user and decomposes it into its prime factors. 
The program ensures that the input is valid and outputs the prime factors separated by spaces.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a number greater than 1.
2. If the number is less than or equal to 1, it displays an error message: `"Error: n>1 expected!"`
3. If the input is valid, the program finds all prime factors of the number and prints them separated by spaces.

### Example Output
Please insert a number: 84
2 2 3 7
